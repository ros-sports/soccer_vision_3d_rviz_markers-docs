* **Transparency** - Detection Confidence

  Detection confidence is a value between 0.0 and 1.0, or unknown (-1).
  Transparency of the marker is proportional to the confidence.
  Confidence of 1.0 is completely opaque and confidence of 0.0 is completely transparent.
  An unknown confidence (-1), will appear as opaque, identical to a marker with 1.0 confidence.
